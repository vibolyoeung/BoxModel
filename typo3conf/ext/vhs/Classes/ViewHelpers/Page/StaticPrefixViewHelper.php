/**
 * ### Page: Static Prefix
 *
 * Use this ViewHelper to read the contents of the `plugin.tx_vhs.settings.prependPath`
 * TypoScript location - this setting stores the static prefix which gets added to all
 * relative resource URIs generated by VHS; whenever you require a ViewHelper which
 * does not respect this setting you can use this ViewHelper to prepend that setting
 * after the value is returned from the other ViewHelper.
